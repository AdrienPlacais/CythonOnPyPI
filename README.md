# Cython on PyPI

A test package for distributing Cython on (Test)PyPI.

## CI

The `.github/workflows/CI.yml` allows to test the package with gh actions.

## Manual release

The commands in `make pypi` allow to publish a *tagged* version of the package on PyPI.
It started to work after the second "official" release number (without `rc`).
